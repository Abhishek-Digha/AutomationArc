This score is the sum of the weighted scores in each of five performance categories – Energy, Water, Waste, Transportation, and Human Experience – plus the Base Score. Higher scores indicate better performance. The score is based on a global data set of places, and reflects all annual inputs from the previous year. Example: For any date in the year 2018, the racetracks on the Total Performance Score reflect 2017 data.Category Scores:Energy: The score reflects annual greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions per capita. A community’s score increases as it lowers annual GHG emissions per capita. You can view the Energy score on a scale of 0 – 100 or weighted to a score of 0 – 33.Water: The score reflects domestic water use per capita. A community’s score increases as it uses less water per capita. You can view the Water score on a scale of 0 – 100 or weighted to a score of 0 – 15.Waste: The score reflects two inputs: the weight of the municipal solid waste (MSW) generated and the weight of MSW diverted from landfills and incineration via recycling, compost, and other means. A community’s score increases as it generates less waste and as it diverts more waste from landfill. You can view the Waste score on a scale of 0 – 100 or weighted to a score of 0 – 8.Transportation: The score reflects distance traveled in individual vehicles per day per capita. A community’s score increases as it reduces distance traveled per day per capita. You can view the Transportation score on a scale of 0 – 100 or weighted to a score of 0 – 14.Human Experience: The score reflects nine inputs across four sub-categories: Education, Equitability, Prosperity, and Health &amp; Safety. Each sub-category counts equally towards the total Human Experience category score. You can view the Human Experience score on a scale of 0 – 100 or weighted to a score of 0 – 20.The Education sub-category score reflects two inputs: the % of the population 25 years and older that is at least a High School graduate (or equivalent), and the % of the population 25 years and older with at least a Bachelor’s degree (or equivalent). A community’s score increases as both percentages increase.The Equitability sub-category score reflects two inputs: the Median Gross Rent as a % of Household Income and Gini coefficient of income. A community’s score increases as both figures decrease (a Gini coefficient of zero reflects a perfectly equal distribution of income).The Prosperity sub-category score reflects two inputs: Median Household Income and Unemployment rate. A community’s score increases as Median Income increases and as Unemployment rate decreases.The Health &amp; Safety sub-category score reflects three inputs across two sub-sub-categories, Health and Safety, which contribute equally to the Health &amp; Safety sub-category.The Health score reflects two inputs: Median Air Quality Index (AQI) and the number of Air Quality Days Unhealthy for Sensitive Groups. A community’s score increases as both figures decrease.The Safety score reflects the rate of violent crime per year per capita. A community’s score increases as the annual rate of violent crime per capita decreases.Base points:Achieve up to 10 base points by using one or both of these options:OPTION ASubmit specific plans, created within the past three years. More information available here.OPTION BCommit to measuring and tracking a minimum of two (2) metrics in addition to those required to generate a Performance Score. Earn one (1) point for every two (2) additional metrics shared. Project teams can choose from a list of 100+ options OR can create their own.
